## 🔧 How It Works

### NFT Creation & Minting Flow

1. **Collection Creation**: Merchant creates a collection for an event or product
2. **NFT Configuration**: Define NFT metadata, supply, pricing, and attributes
3. **ASA Creation**: System creates Algorand Standard Asset with metadata
4. **IPFS Upload**: NFT image and metadata JSON uploaded to IPFS
5. **Asset Creation Transaction**: Transaction submitted to Algorand network
6. **Confirmation**: Wait for transaction confirmation (typically < 5 seconds)
7. **Storage**: NFT data stored in Firestore with asset ID and IPFS hash

### Purchase & Minting Flow

1. **User Selects NFT**: User browses marketplace and selects NFT to purchase
2. **Payment Transaction**: System creates payment transaction from user to merchant
3. **Wallet Signing**: User signs transaction in connected wallet
4. **Transaction Submission**: Signed transaction submitted to Algorand
5. **Confirmation**: Wait for payment confirmation
6. **Minting**: System mints NFT to user's wallet address
7. **Opt-in Check**: System ensures user has opted into asset (auto-opt-in if needed)
8. **NFT Transfer**: NFT transferred to user's wallet
9. **Record Update**: Purchase and mint records updated in Firestore

### Atomic Swap Flow

1. **Swap Creation**: User A creates swap proposal (NFT X for NFT Y)
2. **Proposal Submission**: Swap proposal stored in Firestore with expiry
3. **User B Notification**: User B sees swap proposal in swap interface
4. **Acceptance**: User B accepts swap proposal
5. **Transaction Group**: System creates atomic transfer group:
   - User A sends NFT X to User B
   - User B sends NFT Y to User A
6. **Dual Signing**: Both users sign their respective transactions
7. **Atomic Execution**: All transactions execute together or all fail
8. **Confirmation**: Swap completion recorded on blockchain and in Firestore

### Tinyman Swap Flow

1. **Asset Selection**: User selects asset to swap and amount
2. **Quote Request**: System requests quote from Tinyman AMM
3. **Quote Display**: Shows receive amount, price impact, fees, minimum received
4. **Slippage Configuration**: User sets slippage tolerance (0.5%, 1%, 3%)
5. **Transaction Preparation**: Tinyman SDK prepares swap transaction group
6. **Wallet Signing**: User signs transactions in wallet
7. **Swap Execution**: Transactions submitted to Tinyman and Algorand
8. **Confirmation**: Wait for blockchain confirmation
9. **Balance Update**: User's balance refreshed with new amounts
